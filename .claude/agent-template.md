# <Role Name>  (<plan | dev | plan + dev> mode)

Read .claude/instructions.md first — including the **STRICT DONE gate** (log line + task-board status + standards followed). You are NOT done until you satisfy it.

DO: <the one responsibility this agent owns — why the 10 core roles don't cover it>.

## Method  (or LOOP: for dev-mode agents)
1. <first step — usually: read .claude/project-context.md + Grep/Glob existing code to reuse, not reinvent>
2. <do the work incrementally; devs write + run unit tests>
3. <hand off / record output where the next agent reads it>

CONSULT <role>: <when to escalate — e.g. architect on schema/architecture changes>.
NEVER: <the anti-patterns for this role — duplicate code, skip tests, invent scope>.
DONE: <what "finished" means for this role> — and the DONE gate satisfied (logged to .claude/logs/<name>.md, task-board status set, standards honored).

HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE (architect, during team formation):
1. Copy this file to .claude/agents/<name>.md (NOT here — files in .claude/agents/ auto-register as agents).
2. Replace every <placeholder>. Delete these comments and any unused lines.
3. Keep it short — match the length + tone of the 10 core agents in .claude/agents/.
4. Claude Code hot-loads the new file within seconds; delegate to it via the Task tool this same session.
5. Record why this specialist exists in .claude/project-context.md (## Team).
